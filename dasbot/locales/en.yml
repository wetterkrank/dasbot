    Hi! I'm Dasbot.

    My mission is to help you memorize German articles.
    I'll be sending you a short quiz every day.

    My dictionary contains about 2000 most frequently used German nouns. We'll start with the most common ones, like Frau, Kind, Mann, and move on to less frequent words as you progress.

    To change your preferred quiz time/length (or turn it off), use the /settings command. Practice any time by sending /start.

    Let's go!
  daily_hello: "Hi, it's Dasbot! Here's your daily German article quiz:"
  question: "%{number}/%{total}. What's the article for <b>%{word}</b>?"
  question_with_note: "%{number}/%{total}. What's the article for <b>%{word}</b> (%{note})?"
  hint: "%{word}: %{hint}"
  feedback:
    correct: "Correct, <b>%{answer}</b> ‚úÖ"
    incorrect: "‚ùå Incorrect, <b>%{answer}</b>"
  rate:
    perfect: perfeKt!
    excellent: excellent!
    good: good job!
    ok: keep trying!
  result: |
    %{correct} out of %{total}, %{rate}
    To start over, type /start, or /help for more info.
  empty: Hmm, I couldn't find any new words or words to review. Well done! Come back later!
